# 🔧 Code and Code Type Storage Fix Summary

## 🎯 Issue Identified

The "Code" and "Code Type" columns were not storing values because of a **data overwrite issue** in the `actor-update` API route.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem Flow:
1. ✅ **Import API** correctly stores `code` and `code_type` values when a run starts
2. ❌ **Actor Update API** overwrites these values during progress updates
3. ❌ **Upsert operation** only includes explicitly set fields, excluding `code` and `code_type`
4. ❌ **Result**: Code values are lost after the first progress update

### Technical Details:
- The `actor-update` route uses `upsert` to update run records
- The `upsert` operation only includes fields explicitly set in `runData`
- `code` and `code_type` were not being preserved during updates
- Each progress update from APIFY would overwrite the original values

## 🛠️ Solution Implemented

### Fix Applied to `app/api/actor-update/route.ts`:

```typescript
// CRITICAL FIX: Preserve code and code_type values from existing record
if (currentRun) {
  // Preserve existing code and code_type values if they exist
  if (currentRun.code !== null && currentRun.code !== undefined) {
    runData.code = currentRun.code
  }
  if (currentRun.code_type !== null && currentRun.code_type !== undefined) {
    runData.code_type = currentRun.code_type
  }
}
```

### Debug Logging Added:
- Added detailed logging to both `import` and `actor-update` routes
- Logs show what data is received and what's being stored
- Helps track the data flow and identify issues

## 📊 Expected Results After Fix

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Code and Code Type columns show empty/null values
- ❌ Values are lost after first progress update
- ❌ No way to track what code was used for each run

### After Fix:
- ✅ Code and Code Type values are preserved throughout the run
- ✅ Values persist through all progress updates
- ✅ Frontend displays correct values in the table
- ✅ Historical data shows what code was used for each run

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Deploy the Changes
1. Deploy the updated `actor-update` route to Vercel
2. Deploy the updated `import` route with debug logging

### Step 2: Test the Fix
1. **Start a new import** from the frontend
2. **Enter a code value** (e.g., "ABC123")
3. **Select a code type** (e.g., "HR Cockpit")
4. **Monitor the logs** in Vercel function logs
5. **Check the database** to see if values are preserved

### Step 3: Verify Results
1. **Check frontend table** - Code and Code Type columns should show values
2. **Check database** - Run the verification SQL scripts
3. **Monitor progress updates** - Values should persist through the entire run

## 🔍 Verification Scripts

### Database Verification:
Run `test_code_storage.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor to:
- Check current data in the runs table
- Count runs with actual code values
- Show runs that have non-null code values
- Display the most recent runs with their code values

### Log Monitoring:
Check Vercel function logs for:
- Import API debug logs showing received data
- Actor Update logs showing preserved values
- Database insertion confirmations

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Data Recovery:
- **Existing runs** will still show empty/null values (this is expected)
- **New runs** will properly store and preserve code values
- **No data loss** - the fix only affects future runs

### Monitoring:
- Monitor the logs for the first few runs after deployment
- Verify that code values are being preserved through progress updates
- Check that the frontend displays the values correctly

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After implementing the fix:
- ✅ New imports store code and code_type values correctly
- ✅ Values persist through all progress updates
- ✅ Frontend displays Code and Code Type columns with actual values
- ✅ Database queries return the expected data structure
- ✅ No more empty/null values for new runs

## 📝 Files Modified
